# TMF909_NaaSComponentSuite
The scope of this document is to define the API Component Suite in support of a set of Operational Domains exposing and managing “Network” Services. These services are referred to as Network as a Service (NaaS) and include all services offered from a service providers including connectivity, end points, media services, etc. An Operational Domain supports a set of functions and capabilities responsible for the complete lifecycle of services and resources within its domain, including exposure of services supported by SLAs, interfacing via standard TMF APIs with the BSS systems and other operational domains. The API set supports the control plane for the services and not the delivery of the service.
